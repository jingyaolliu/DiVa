# DiVa
## What's included
This repository contains the dataset and source code for the models utilized in the publication "DiVa: An Iterative Framework to Harvest More Diverse and Valid Labels from User Comments for Music", which was presented at ACM MM2023.
## About Diva
DiVa is an iterative framework designed to obtain song labels from user comments. It leverages the knowledge provided by a small number of gold labels annotated by experts and a large amount of user comments to obtain more diverse and valid labels for each song. DiVa ultimately yields a complete set of song labels for each song.
